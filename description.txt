Universal Throwing (UThrowing) is a small mod that re-adds the throwing class for Terraria, to help prepare throwing weapons for 1.4
Should be cross-functional with the vanilla damage type for the time being

Update, should now boost both vanilla and modded throwing and allow for some (atm limited) prefixes

-Trap weapons could crit, this was unintended

-Fixed stacking velocity bug
